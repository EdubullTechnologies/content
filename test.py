* Create concept-wise summaries (visuals are optional but helpful)
* Integrate special features within the core concept flow rather than as separate sections
* DO NOT change the original concept names/terminology from the uploaded PDF

**Instructions for Analysis and Rewrite:**
1.  **Read and understand the entire PDF chapter.** Pay attention to text, images, diagrams, and overall structure, keeping the **{grade_level}** student in mind.
2.  **Compare the chapter to each element** in the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements'.
3.  **Identify deficiencies:** Where does the uploaded chapter fall short for a **{grade_level}** audience and the model? Be specific.
4.  **Analyze Images:** For each image in the PDF, assess its:
    *   Relevance to the surrounding text and learning objectives for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Clarity and quality.
    *   Age-appropriateness for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Presence of any specific characters if expected (e.g., 'EeeBee').
5.  **Suggest Image Actions:**
    *   If an image is good, state that it should be kept.
    *   If an image needs improvement (e.g., better clarity, different focus for **{grade_level}**), describe the improvement.
    *   If an image is irrelevant, unsuitable, or missing, provide a detailed prompt for an AI image generator to create a new, appropriate image suitable for **{grade_level}**. The prompt should be clearly marked, e.g., "[PROMPT FOR NEW IMAGE: A detailed description of the image needed, including style, content, characters like 'EeeBee' if applicable, and educational purpose for **{grade_level}**.]"
6.  **Rewrite the Chapter:** Create a new version of the chapter that:
    *   Follows the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements' strictly.
    *   MUST include ALL elements from the REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE in the order specified.
    *   Corrects all identified mistakes and deficiencies.
    *   Integrates image feedback directly into the text.
    *   Ensures content is aligned with NCERT, NCF, and NEP 2020 principles (e.g., inquiry-based learning, 21st-century skills, real-world connections) appropriate for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Is written in clear, engaging, and age-appropriate language for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
    *   Use Markdown for formatting (headings, bold, italics, lists) to make it easy to convert to a Word document. For example:
        # Chapter Title
        ## Section Title
        **Bold Text**
        *Italic Text*
        - Item 1
        - Item 2
    *   Present content in proper textbook paragraphs like a NCERT textbook
    *   Include multiple Bloom's Taxonomy questions at various levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) in each appropriate section
    *   Organize summaries by individual concepts rather than as a single summary
    *   Weave special features (misconceptions, 21st century skills, etc.) into the core concept flow
    *   PRESERVE all original concept names and terminology from the source PDF

IMPORTANT: Do NOT directly copy large portions of text from the PDF. Instead, use your own words to rewrite and improve the content while maintaining the original concepts and terminology.

**Output Format:**
Provide the complete, rewritten chapter text in Markdown format, incorporating all analyses and image prompts as described. Do not include a preamble or a summary of your analysis; just the final chapter content.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**: This prompt is EXCLUSIVELY for Mathematics Classes 1-5. DO NOT apply Model Chapter Progression or any other structure. Follow ONLY the structure specified below.

**Section 0: Prompt Scope and Limitation**
- Specific Application: This is exclusively for transforming Mathematics textbooks for Classes 1 through 5
- Do NOT extend this structure to any other subject or higher grade levels
- This requires a fundamentally different pedagogical approach than secondary education

**Your Role**: Transform the provided PDF chapter into a new, market-leading format using expert pedagogical judgment.

**Target Audience**: {grade_level} (Primary Mathematics - Ages 6-11)

**Three Golden Rules for Transformation**:
1. **PRESERVE THE CORE CONCEPT**: Identify the core mathematical concept(s) and fundamental pedagogical sequence in the PDF
2. **RESTRUCTURE THE LAYOUT**: Completely discard the old layout and use our mandatory four-part lean structure
3. **DETERMINE OPTIMAL LENGTH**: Use expert judgment based on topic complexity (no fixed page limits)

Your task is to analyze the provided PDF document, which is a book chapter intended for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
This is the user's OWN CONTENT being used for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

IMPORTANT: This is the user's own copyright material, and they have explicitly authorized its analysis and transformation for educational purposes. Please proceed with the analysis and rewriting.

You need to evaluate it against the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements' provided below.
The final output should be a completely rewritten and improved chapter that incorporates all necessary corrections and adheres to the model, suitable for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
The book is intended to align with NCERT, NCF, and NEP 2020 guidelines. The book should be according to the NCERT books for **{grade_level}**.

**Model Chapter Progression and Elements:**
---
{model_progression_text}
---

**REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE:**
The improved chapter MUST follow this specific structure:
1. Current Concepts
2. Hook (with Image Prompt)
3. Learning Outcome
4. Real world connection
5. Previous class concept
6. History
7. Summary
10. Exercise (with the following 5 question types, each with appropriate number of questions):
   - MCQ
   - Assertion and Reason
   - Fill in the Blanks
   - True False
   - Define the following terms
   - Match the column
   - Give Reason for the following Statement (Easy Level)
   - Answer in Brief (Moderate Level)
   - Answer in Detail (Hard Level)
11. Skill based Activity
12. Activity Time ‚Äì STEM
13. Creativity ‚Äì Art
14. Case Study ‚Äì Level 1
15. Case Study ‚Äì Level 2

**Target Audience:** {grade_level} (CBSE Syllabus)

**Important Formatting Requirements:**
* Format like a proper textbook with well-structured paragraphs (not too long but sufficiently developed)
* Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content
* Include multiple Bloom's Taxonomy questions at different levels in each relevant section
* Create concept-wise summaries (visuals are optional but helpful)
* Integrate special features within the core concept flow rather than as separate sections
* DO NOT change the original concept names/terminology from the uploaded PDF

**Instructions for Analysis and Rewrite:**
1.  **Read and understand the entire PDF chapter.** Pay attention to text, images, diagrams, and overall structure, keeping the **{grade_level}** student in mind.
2.  **Compare the chapter to each element** in the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements'.
3.  **Identify deficiencies:** Where does the uploaded chapter fall short for a **{grade_level}** audience and the model? Be specific.
4.  **Analyze Images:** For each image in the PDF, assess its:
    *   Relevance to the surrounding text and learning objectives for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Clarity and quality.
    *   Age-appropriateness for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Presence of any specific characters if expected (e.g., 'EeeBee').
5.  **Suggest Image Actions:**
    *   If an image is good, state that it should be kept.
    *   If an image needs improvement (e.g., better clarity, different focus for **{grade_level}**), describe the improvement.
    *   If an image is irrelevant, unsuitable, or missing, provide a detailed prompt for an AI image generator to create a new, appropriate image suitable for **{grade_level}**. The prompt should be clearly marked, e.g., "[PROMPT FOR NEW IMAGE: A detailed description of the image needed, including style, content, characters like 'EeeBee' if applicable, and educational purpose for **{grade_level}**.]"
6.  **Rewrite the Chapter:** Create a new version of the chapter that:
    *   Follows the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements' strictly.
    *   MUST include ALL elements from the REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE in the order specified.
    *   Corrects all identified mistakes and deficiencies.
    *   Integrates image feedback directly into the text.
    *   Ensures content is aligned with NCERT, NCF, and NEP 2020 principles (e.g., inquiry-based learning, 21st-century skills, real-world connections) appropriate for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Is written in clear, engaging, and age-appropriate language for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
    *   Use Markdown for formatting (headings, bold, italics, lists) to make it easy to convert to a Word document. For example:
        # Chapter Title
        ## Section Title
        **Bold Text**
        *Italic Text*
        - Item 1
        - Item 2
    *   Present content in proper textbook paragraphs like a NCERT textbook
    *   Include multiple Bloom's Taxonomy questions at various levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) in each appropriate section
    *   Organize summaries by individual concepts rather than as a single summary
    *   Weave special features (misconceptions, 21st century skills, etc.) into the core concept flow
    *   PRESERVE all original concept names and terminology from the source PDF

IMPORTANT: Do NOT directly copy large portions of text from the PDF. Instead, use your own words to rewrite and improve the content while maintaining the original concepts and terminology.

**Output Format:**
Provide the complete, rewritten chapter text in Markdown format, incorporating all analyses and image prompts as described. Do not include a preamble or a summary of your analysis; just the final chapter content.

Your task is to analyze the provided PDF document, which is a book chapter intended for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
This is the user's OWN CONTENT being used for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

IMPORTANT: This is the user's own copyright material, and they have explicitly authorized its analysis and transformation for educational purposes. Please proceed with the analysis and rewriting.

You need to evaluate it against the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements' provided below.
The final output should be a completely rewritten and improved chapter that incorporates all necessary corrections and adheres to the model, suitable for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
The book is intended to align with NCERT, NCF, and NEP 2020 guidelines. The book should be according to the NCERT books for **{grade_level}**.

**Model Chapter Progression and Elements:**
---
{model_progression_text}
---

**REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE:**
The improved chapter MUST follow this specific structure:
1. Current Concepts
2. Hook (with Image Prompt)
3. Learning Outcome
4. Real world connection
5. Previous class concept
6. History
7. Summary
10. Exercise (with the following 5 question types, each with appropriate number of questions):
   - MCQ
   - Assertion and Reason
   - Fill in the Blanks
   - True False
   - Define the following terms
   - Match the column
   - Give Reason for the following Statement (Easy Level)
   - Answer in Brief (Moderate Level)
   - Answer in Detail (Hard Level)
11. Skill based Activity
12. Activity Time ‚Äì STEM
13. Creativity ‚Äì Art
14. Case Study ‚Äì Level 1
15. Case Study ‚Äì Level 2

**Target Audience:** {grade_level} (CBSE Syllabus)

**Important Formatting Requirements:**
* Format like a proper textbook with well-structured paragraphs (not too long but sufficiently developed)
* Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content
* Include multiple Bloom's Taxonomy questions at different levels in each relevant section
* Create concept-wise summaries (visuals are optional but helpful)
* Integrate special features within the core concept flow rather than as separate sections
* DO NOT change the original concept names/terminology from the uploaded PDF

**Instructions for Analysis and Rewrite:**
1.  **Read and understand the entire PDF chapter.** Pay attention to text, images, diagrams, and overall structure, keeping the **{grade_level}** student in mind.
2.  **Compare the chapter to each element** in the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements'.
3.  **Identify deficiencies:** Where does the uploaded chapter fall short for a **{grade_level}** audience and the model? Be specific.
4.  **Analyze Images:** For each image in the PDF, assess its:
    *   Relevance to the surrounding text and learning objectives for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Clarity and quality.
    *   Age-appropriateness for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Presence of any specific characters if expected (e.g., 'EeeBee').
5.  **Suggest Image Actions:**
    *   If an image is good, state that it should be kept.
    *   If an image needs improvement (e.g., better clarity, different focus for **{grade_level}**), describe the improvement.
    *   If an image is irrelevant, unsuitable, or missing, provide a detailed prompt for an AI image generator to create a new, appropriate image suitable for **{grade_level}**. The prompt should be clearly marked, e.g., "[PROMPT FOR NEW IMAGE: A detailed description of the image needed, including style, content, characters like 'EeeBee' if applicable, and educational purpose for **{grade_level}**.]"
6.  **Rewrite the Chapter:** Create a new version of the chapter that:
    *   Follows the 'Model Chapter Progression and Elements' strictly.
    *   MUST include ALL elements from the REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE in the order specified.
    *   Corrects all identified mistakes and deficiencies.
    *   Integrates image feedback directly into the text.
    *   Ensures content is aligned with NCERT, NCF, and NEP 2020 principles (e.g., inquiry-based learning, 21st-century skills, real-world connections) appropriate for **{grade_level}**.
    *   Is written in clear, engaging, and age-appropriate language for **{grade_level} (CBSE)**.
    *   Use Markdown for formatting (headings, bold, italics, lists) to make it easy to convert to a Word document.
    *   Present content in proper textbook paragraphs like a NCERT textbook
    *   Include multiple Bloom's Taxonomy questions at various levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) in each appropriate section
    *   Organize summaries by individual concepts rather than as a single summary
    *   Weave special features (misconceptions, 21st century skills, etc.) into the core concept flow
    *   PRESERVE all original concept names and terminology from the source PDF

IMPORTANT: Do NOT directly copy large portions of text from the PDF. Instead, use your own words to rewrite and improve the content while maintaining the original concepts and terminology.

**Output Format:**
Provide the complete, rewritten chapter text in Markdown format, incorporating all analyses and image prompts as described. Do not include a preamble or a summary of your analysis; just the final chapter content.
